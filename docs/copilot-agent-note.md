# Using GitHub Copilot's coding agent as a second comparison point

`ai-improve.yml` automates only Gemini (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, called
directly via REST — the only model here with a genuine free API tier).
GitHub Copilot's autonomous coding agent (free on GitHub Free/Pro with a
monthly premium-request quota) does not run as a plain `uses:` step
inside a workflow YAML the same way — it's invoked by **assigning a
GitHub Issue to `@copilot`**, and it opens its own PR.

To use it as a second data point for the same "improve algorithm and
performance" task, for a manual apples-to-apples comparison against the
Gemini-authored PR:

1. Open an issue in this repo:
   - Title: `Improve algorithm and performance`
   - Body: paste the same constraints block used in `ai-improve.yml`'s
     prompt (scope to `src/pycli/wordstat.py` + tests, Google style,
     keep 100% coverage, no new deps, prefer O(n)/O(n log n)).
2. Assign the issue to `Copilot`.
3. Copilot opens a PR on its own branch; `ci.yml` runs automatically
   against it (lint + 100%-coverage gate) same as any other PR.
4. Run `uv run python scripts/benchmark.py` locally against Copilot's
   branch and compare its `before.txt`/`after.txt` numbers to the
   Gemini-authored PR from `ai-improve.yml`.

This keeps Copilot in the same review-gated model (PR + CI + manual
merge) as the Gemini workflow, just triggered differently.
